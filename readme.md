# Assorted Breakout Boards
This is a collection of small breakout boards for small devices that I made with KiCad 

## Alps 5 Way Switch (`alps-5-way-switch`)

A breakout board for two five way switches designed by ALPS.  One of the switches is the [SKQUCAA010](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/SKQUCAA010-ALPS.pdf), which is now discontinued.  The other switch is the [SKRHAxE010](https://www.mouser.co.uk/datasheet/2/15/SKRH-1370966.pdf), which isn't discontinued.

## ESP32 WROVER (`esp32-wrover-breakout`)

This is a breakout board for the ESP32-WROOM-32 and ESP32-WROVER modules.  This probably won't work with the ESP32-S2.

## I²S Microphone (`i2c-mic-breakout`)

This is a breakout for the really tiny [SPH0645LM4H-B](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/product-files/3421/i2S+Datasheet.PDF), which is an I²S microphone.

## QFN-16 (`qfn-16-3mm-breakout`)

<img src="images/qfn-16-pcb.png" height="200">

This is a breakout board for 3x3mm or 4x4mm QFN-16 chips that are 0.5mm pitch.

## QFN-24 (`qfn-24-breakout`)

<img src="images/qfn-24-bottom.png" height="200">
<img src="images/qfn-24-pcb.png" height="200">

A breakout board for 3x3mm QFN-24 chips, with 0.4mm pitch.  It is delibrately designed so that the chip is parallel with the board so chips like IMUs point upwards when connected to a breadboard.
